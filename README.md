# Smart Conveyor System

## Overview

The **Smart Conveyor System** is an automated solution designed to identify and sort objects on a conveyor belt using a Raspberry Pi, AI-based object detection, and MQTT communication. This system halts the conveyor when an object is detected, classifies the object using a camera and AI model, and then directs it appropriately using servo motors controlled by ESP microcontrollers.

## Features

- **Automated Conveyor Control**: Uses an IR sensor to detect objects and stop the conveyor for processing.
- **AI-Based Object Detection**: Raspberry Pi Camera and Python detect objects using machine learning.
- **MQTT Communication**: Sends classification results via MQTT for real-time handling.
- **Dynamic Sorting**: Servo motors controlled by ESPs direct objects based on type.
- **Health Monitoring**: ESPs send "alive" signals to the Raspberry Pi.

## System Workflow

1. **Detection**:
   - IR sensor detects object under Pi Camera and sends signal to Raspberry Pi.
   - Raspberry Pi cuts power to the relay, stopping the conveyor.

2. **Classification**:
   - Camera captures image.
   - Python script runs AI model to detect the object.
   - Result is broadcast over MQTT.

3. **Sorting**:
   - ESP microcontrollers receive the MQTT message.
   - Corresponding servo motor is activated to route the object.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Each ESP sends a status message back to the Raspberry Pi.
